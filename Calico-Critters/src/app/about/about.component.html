        Hey everyone!! I'm Jenelise, an online CSU student. Originally, I'm from
        Orange County, California! I'm in my last few semesters of finishing my
        Bachelor's in Computer Science at CSU. I am also getting a teacher's
        license from CSU. I'm very excited about making an uplifting impact in
        the educational system, bringing insights and knowledge from the world
        of technology! My favorite things in life are family, church, milk tea,
        and jalape√±o cheddar bread.
